//start a function for asking the first question 
//then the second question
//etc.

//check time function
//checks to see if they got the previous question right or wrong
//if wrong lowers time
//then it checks to make sure the user still has time
//if they don't have time make variable game over

//first question function. has to change the html header into a question
//add a list of todos?
//conditional on whether you selected the correct answer
//if incorrect, timer decreases
//returns with a timer decrease and goes to next question
// or if correct just goes to the next question
